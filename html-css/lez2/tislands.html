                    <p>Some like their holidays active, others like things slow. There is no
                        shame in going on holiday, kicking back and doing absolutely nothing, yet so
                        often in reality it doesn't quite work out like that. Arrive in a new
                        destination, and most of us will instantly want to head out and explore every
                        nook and cranny. We just can't help ourselves.</p>

                    <p>We have come up with a few locations that will help you a hand in
                        resolving this conondrum. These destinations feature some of the most
                        spectacular scenery seen anywhere in the world, but there is not much to do
                        other than gawk at it in awe, and kick back...</p>
