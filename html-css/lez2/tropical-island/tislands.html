                                                nowhere. It has 2,000 inhabitants and has a single road connecting
                                                everything.
                                                So tiny, yet such great scenery and no way to easily get off the island.

                                        Maybe we are spoiled. We are running this website out of tropical Singapore,
                                        which means year-round warm temperatures at home anyway, but also countless
                                        fantastic South-east Asian travel destinations just a weekend trip away. Whether
                                        we want to jet off to Bali or Phuket, to Bangkok or Hong Kong, it is often a
                                        matter of conveniently flying off on a budget airline after work on a Friday and
                                        returning late on a Sunday.

                                        The only downside to this is that we are not the only one doing this! You can
                                        fly to Krabi or Nha Trang, but then in many places you will still spend your
                                        weekend packed like sardines on a beach, next to your neighbours back home. Long
                                        story short, sometimes you want to head off to a place with palm trees and white
                                        sand beaches but at the same time get away from the crowds as well. If that's
                                        what you are after, we have some suggestions for you (that are not just located
                                        in Asia, of course). For even more inspiration just use our Destination Search.

                                    <p class="card-text">The first destination is an island well off the coast of Brazil
                                        in
                                        South America called Fernando de Noronha. This is a renowned eco travel
                                        destination that
                                        might just be one of the most pretty spots to visit in Brazil. But as it is
                                        pretty out
                                        of the way, the (domestic and foreign) crowds don't seem to have quite
                                        discovered it. So
                                        go here, enjoy some hiking into the rocky jungle covered interior, or enjoy the
                                        water
                                        and go swimming, surfing or diving. Take note that accomodation here is basic at
                                        best,
                                        but then that's the whole point isn't it?

                                        Marine Park in Sabah of Malaysia. You will need to travel to Semporna and spend
                                        the
                                        night there, then make your way here by boat. The main sight is the volcanic

                                        is under water and which you get spectacular views over after you have made the

                                        of climbing your way up through the thick jungle... Once you find your way down

                                        you can go swimming or snorkeling although you won't find any real beaches. But
                                        then
                                        again you won't find many people either!
